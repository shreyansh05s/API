We assume ```docker``` and ```docker-compose``` to be available on your system, if not then they can be installed using the package manager of your choice for your platform.

Open a terminal on the ```src``` folder of this project and run the following command

 ```$ docker-compose up```
 
Wait for a couple of minutes for all services to run
